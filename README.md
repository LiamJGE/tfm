## Title: Enhancing Poor-Quality Datasets with Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Machine Learning Models

### Overview

This repository contains the code, datasets, and results associated with my Master's thesis. The research investigates how knowledge graph embeddings, specifically OWL2Vec* and TransE, can improve the performance of machine learning models on poor-quality datasets. These datasets are characterized by a limited number of features or features not closely related to the machine learning task. The goal is to enrich these datasets with knowledge graph embeddings to improve classification and regression performance.

### Abstract

This thesis explores how poor-quality datasets can be enhanced through knowledge graph embeddings to improve machine learning model performance in classification and regression tasks. It extends the OWL2Vec* algorithm and compares its performance with the TransE embedding technique. The research finds that the usefulness of these embeddings depends heavily on how correlated features are represented within the knowledge graph. The study highlights that OWL2Vec* is more versatile in handling diverse information types, while TransE excels at understanding inter-entity relationships.

### Key Objectives

1. **RO1**: Assess whether knowledge graph embeddings can improve machine learning models' performance on poor-quality datasets.
2. **RO2**: Investigate possible improvements in embedding algorithms for classification and regression tasks.
3. **RO3**: Analyze how embedding algorithms interpret relevant data in knowledge graphs and the impact of different feature representations on embedding quality.

### Key Findings

- OWL2Vec* is better at interpreting information when features are represented as classes or attributes in the knowledge graph.
- TransE is more efficient in capturing relationships between entities.
- A combined approach, using OWL2Vec* for entity classes and TransE for relationships, could leverage the strengths of both algorithms.
- Careful design of knowledge graphs is critical for maximizing the utility of graph embeddings.

### Conclusion

The research demonstrated the potential for using knowledge graph embeddings to improve machine learning tasks on datasets with limited features. However, the application of graph embeddings is highly dependent on the structure and information richness of the knowledge graph. OWL2Vec* and TransE offer complementary strengths, and future work could explore more sophisticated embeddings, such as those generated by large language models (LLMs).

### Future Work

- Explore the integration of advanced LLMs (e.g., BERT, GPT) in place of the word2vec component in OWL2Vec*.
- Perform more extensive experiments on diverse datasets and tasks, including link prediction, node classification, and entity resolution.
- Investigate real-world applications with carefully designed knowledge graphs for superior performance.
