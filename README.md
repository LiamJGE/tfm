## Abstract

This thesis explores methods to enhance poor-quality datasets characterized by a limited number of features or features poorly related to machine learning tasks. The approach integrates knowledge graph embeddings to improve the performance of machine learning models in both classification and regression tasks. Specifically, the study extends OWL2Vec* and evaluates the efficacy of TransE and the extended OWL2Vec* embeddings. The research highlights that the effectiveness of these embeddings in regression and classification tasks depends significantly on the presence and quality of correlated features represented within the knowledge graph.

The findings reveal that OWL2Vec* exhibits greater versatility in interpreting information in diverse formats, particularly effective in handling relevant features represented as classes or attributes. Conversely, TransE excels in understanding relationships between entities within the knowledge graph. This research underscores the critical role of well-designed knowledge graphs and proposes avenues for future research to achieve even more robust embeddings.
